# Smart-Parking-System

🚗 Real-Time Smart Parking System using YOLOv11 & OpenCV  
Developed a real-time AI-based parking detection system to reduce traffic congestion and improve efficiency.  
The system processes live video streams to detect occupied and vacant parking spots with high accuracy and low latency.  
Potential integration with IoT and mobile apps enables full automation for smart city infrastructure.
